# Chain Beasts Game Guide

Welcome to **Chain Beasts**, a fully on-chain creature battler. Every beast is a tiny neural network that lives forever on the blockchain. Hatch them, train them with real compute and send them into provably fair battles.

## Hatch

Creatures spawn from deterministic seeds so anyone can verify their initial stats. Sensors and appendages are baked into the genesis block and define how your beast perceives the world and acts within it.

## Train

Run the open-source INT8 kernel locally or in your browser to make your beast stronger. Checkpoints are committed on-chain where other players can replay or verify them.

## Battle

Use the matchmaker contract to challenge opponents. The battle loop is deterministicâ€”power, defense and stamina decide the outcome. Animations can be replayed by anyone.

## Style & Trade

Fashion items modify appearance and minor stats. Lease or trade your beasts on the marketplace and vote in seasonal fashion contests.

See [Architecture](Architecture.md) and [Philosophy](Philosophy.md) for the technical and design details.
