# Project Philosophy – “Chain‑Beasts”

---

## 1 Vision

Turn deterministic machine‑learning creatures into a playable, provably‑fair digital ecology where *work* (compute & creativity) directly mints value and every rule is open for anyone to audit.

## 2 Core Principles

\|  | Principle | Why it matters |
\|‑|‑|‑|
\| **P1** | **Determinism > randomness** | Same inputs → same outputs; removes hidden advantage and simplifies verification. |
\| **P2** | **Proof beats trust** | Everything—genesis, training, battles, fashion votes—reduces to on‑chain commitments + reproducible math or succinct proofs. |
\| **P3** | **Earned ownership** | Tokens and NFTs accrue only through verifiable work (training, validation, voting) rather than passive staking or luck. |
\| **P4** | **Skillful play, capped whales** | Quadratic voting, energy caps, and seasonal leagues reward smart strategies over raw capital. |
\| **P5** | **Sustainable complexity** | Small kernels & short proof paths keep decentralisation affordable as the game scales. |
\| **P6** | **Forkable but coherent** | Rulebooks / constants hashed into state → anyone can spin a new league without fragmenting core assets. |
\| **P7** | **Fun is the final arbiter** | All economic and cryptographic elegance is worthless if the game loop isn’t engaging. Fun vetoes orthodoxy. |

## 3 Purpose Statements

1. **Player agency** – Give users granular control over training directions, cosmetic expression, and governance levers.
2. **Network health** – Align incentives so every Harmonics GPU cycle and every vote strengthens security or content diversity.
3. **Transparency** – Treat code + math as public infrastructure; obscurity is a bug.
4. **Longevity** – Design for a 10‑year horizon: small on‑chain footprint, modular upgrades, no single custodial choke‑point.

## 4 Why Blockchain at All?

* Guarantees scarce, tradable identities without central servers.
* Turns normally wasted hash‑power into forward progress (model validation).
* Enables community‑governed rule tweaks instead of unilateral patches.

## 5 Why Quantised Deterministic ML?

* Shrinks proofs and replay cost → keeps node barrier low.
* Makes cloning meaningless—anyone can *regenerate* but cannot claim your training path.
* Forces designers to think in constrained, elegant algorithms instead of gigabyte bloat.

## 6 Social Contract

> “If you can prove it, you can earn from it; if you can’t, it doesn’t exist.”

Players agree to:

* Respect energy and stake commitments.
* Accept on‑chain outcomes as final.
* Contribute to validator uptime **or** pay minimum fees that fund those who do.

Developers agree to:

* Open‑source all critical code (kernel, contracts, proof circuits).
* Publish economic param changes ≥7 days before activation.
* Maintain the baseline league free of paywalls.

## 7 Long‑Term Goals

1. **ZK Phase‑2** – One‑proof‑per‑epoch without raising hardware reqs.
2. **Creator economy** – Modders can author new cosmetics / rulesets tethered by hash IDs.
3. **Cross‑game composability** – Creatures act as wallets/agents in partner games via Layer‑0 proofs.
4. **Carbon‑aware compute** – Reward validators running on green energy.
